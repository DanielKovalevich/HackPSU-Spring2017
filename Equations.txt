FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value
Pmt = Payment
N = Number of Periods
i = Interest Rate




Future Value with Continuous Investment

FV = Pmt*(((1+i)^N-1)/i)




Future Value with Single Investment

FV = Pmt*(1+i)^N




Present Value of Desired Future Sum

PV = FV/(1+i)^N



Continuous Payment Required to Achieve Future Sum

Pmt = FV/(((1+i)^N-1)/i)
